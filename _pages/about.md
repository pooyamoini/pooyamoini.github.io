I'm currently a third-year undergrad in Computer Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology and Also minor in Math.
My research interests include Statistics, Machine Learning and Information theory in general and Deep learning, Meta learning as Distributed Learning in particular. Currently I am research assistant at <a href="www.dml.ir">DML</a> laboratory and a member of social networks team. Also, I am interested in the academic space and willing to work in this space in the future, rather than industrial space. For more information please check my <a href="/files/cv.pdf">CV</a>.
